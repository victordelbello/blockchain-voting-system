# Decentralized Voting System

**Problem**: In many voting systems, the transparency and integrity of the votes are a concern. How can we be sure that the votes have not been altered or that the process was not corrupted?

**Solution**: A blockchain-based voting system might be the answer. Blockchain ensures that each vote is recorded in an immutable manner, guaranteeing transparency and integrity.

## Basic Features:

-   **Voter Registration**: Create a system where voters can register using a public key.
-   **Voting**: Voters can vote using their private key, ensuring the authenticity of the vote. A voter can only vote once.
-   **Vote Counting**: Anyone can verify and count the votes since they are transparent and on the blockchain.
-   **Results**: Once the voting is closed, the results can be verified by anyone.

## Technologies:

-   **Ethereum**: As the blockchain platform.
-   **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts.
-   **Web3.js**: To connect your frontend website to the blockchain.
-   **Frontend**: A simple one using HTML/CSS/JS.
